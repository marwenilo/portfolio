The "d.ts" file is used to provide typescript type information about an API that's written in JavaScript. 
The idea is that you're using something like jQuery or underscore, 
an existing javascript library. You want to consume those from your typescript code.

****************************************************************

"d" stands for Declaration Files:

When a TypeScript script gets compiled there is an option to generate a declaration file (with the extension .d.ts) 
that functions as an interface to the components in the compiled JavaScript. 
In the process the compiler strips away all function and method bodies and preserves only the signatures of the types 
that are exported. The resulting declaration file can then be used to describe the exported virtual TypeScript 
types of a JavaScript library or module when a third-party developer consumes it from TypeScript.
